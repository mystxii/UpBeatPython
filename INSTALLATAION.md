  <b>Installation</b>

<br>

This module works in Python 2.7 & 3.5+. This is due to the dependency: `requests`.

To install the module, you first need to install `upbeat.py`. You can do this by pressing [here](https://upbeatpy.ml/downloads/v1.0/upbeat.py).

> Some internet browsers may mark this download as dangerous. This is expected as Python files are excitable files. We can assure that this file is safe. If you do not believe us, you can view the source code by pressing [here](https://gitlab.com/danieldot/upbeatpython/-/blob/production/src/upbeat.py) to see the source code.

Once you have the `upbeat.py` file in your downloads folder, you will need to move it to your project folder. Once done, your file directory should look like this:
```
ProjectFolder
╠ mainfile.py
╚ upbeat.py
```
When you try and run your main Python file, it may say `Module Not Found: Requests`. This is because `upbeat.py` requires the dependency `requests` to be able to retrieve API. To fix this, the Command-Line commands are attached bellow this.
```
WINDOWS: py -3 -m pip install -U requests
OTHER: python3 -m pip install -U requests
```
From there, you should be good to go! If you require any help, read our Documentation. That does not help, please join our Discord Server!
